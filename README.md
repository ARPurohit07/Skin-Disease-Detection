# Skin Disease Detection Using Deep Learning

This project is a deep learning-based application for detecting different types of skin diseases from medical images. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the **HAM10000** dataset.

## Features
- Image classification using a trained CNN model
- Supports multiple image uploads for batch predictions
- User-friendly web interface built with Streamlit
- Deployed using Streamlit for ease of access

## Dataset

This project uses the **HAM10000** dataset, which consists of **10,015 dermatoscopic images** of skin lesions. The dataset is publicly available on Kaggle.

### **ðŸ”¹ Download Dataset**
1. Visit the dataset page on Kaggle:  
   [HAM10000 Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000)
2. Download the dataset and extract the contents.
3. Place the dataset folders (`HAM10000_images_part_1/`, `HAM10000_images_part_2/`) inside the project directory.
